# Predicting_mortality_for_heart_failure_patients
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of mortality in patients with heart failure using machine learning techniques. By analyzing clinical and biological attributes such as age, anemia, serum sodium, and smoking status, the model helps identify high-risk patients early and supports informed medical decision-making.
